# Easel
Easel is the code name for a 3D renderer for a landscape written in Vulkan.

This was just a fun project to work on learning a bit of Vulkan and see what I could come up with. All rendering is done from scratch.

The project is mostly abandoned.

High Level Features:
- Skybox
- Shadows
- Procedurally Generated Trees
- Animations via Vertex Shaders (and Fragment shaders sometimes?)


Here are some screenshots and things.
